			<p>Hello! My name is Troy Amelotte. I started my journey to become a developer when I was 12. I started to learn because I wanted to run game servers for me and my friends to play on together. As the server grew we invited more and more people. By the time I was 16 I had one of the largest game server networks in the world, Since its start it has had over 300,000 unique players. I was responsible for managing the server, managing the staff, and programming features. After that I went to college to study computer science and game production. However, because of my previous experience school wasn't fufilling my needs and I opted to self teach myself a lot. After that I went on to work as a developer for stayFYT and to teach JavaScript, C#, and Ruby at CodingDojo. I'm a fun person to be around and love a positive and fun work environment. I'm interested in any oppertunity that envolves awesome people and a awesome project.</p>
